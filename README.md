Hilbifetch is your average system info fetch inspired by Neofetch, my own
[Bunnyfetch](https://github.com/Luvella/Bunnyfetch) and the others.  
But this time, it's written and configured in Lua.

# Setup
> Hilbifetch is in a very early state, expect it to look weird or have odd bugs.

## Requirements
- Hilbish v0.4.0-dev.3

# Usage
`lua hilbifetch.lua`  
Or within Hilbish, `dofile 'hilbifetch.lua'`

# License
Hilbifetch is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license.  
[Read here](LICENSE) for more info.
